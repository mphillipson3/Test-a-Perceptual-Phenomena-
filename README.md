# Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomena-

Project Overview
In this project, you will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. You will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.

Prepare for this project with: Statistics.

Why this Project?
Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows you to investigate data and make inferences based on your observations. A foundation in statistics also allows you to be a consumer of analyses that others perform, and allows you to relate to the conclusions others have drawn from their investigations.

What will I Learn?
This project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:
•	How to identify components of an experiment
•	How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
•	How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results

Why is this Important to my Career?
This project is focused on statistics, including designing an experiment and testing a hypothesis. Using statistics to draw valid conclusions about data is an important part of a data analyst's work. When you see a company release a new feature, what do you think went into the decisionmaking? Typically, a business has a goal they want to achieve - for Udacity, it may mean increased enrollments. We'd spend a long time user testing and A/B testing to make sure trials of potential products indicate we'd get the outcome we wanted.



How do I Complete this Project?
This project is connected to the Statistics course, but depending on your background knowledge of statistics, you may not need to take the whole course to complete this project. If you would like, you can use the Statistics Placement Advisor to determine what material you need to review.
Follow these instructions and create a pdf or html document answering the questions. These document formats are compatible across a broad range of computers and browsers and are one of the surest ways of making sure that your intents are received properly. If you are using a word processing program such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice, make sure that you save your document as a pdf and include the pdf in your project submission.
There is no need for specific software for this project, but it will be useful to have at least a spreadsheet program for reading in the data. You are free to select an alternative software program you are more familiar with or are more comfortable using to analyze the data.
